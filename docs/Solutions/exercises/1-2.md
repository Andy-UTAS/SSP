# The specific heat of solids II

## Exercises

### Preliminary provocations

1. Why are there only 3 polarizations when there are 6 degrees of freedom in three-dimensions for an oscillator?

    The polarization is related to the direction of the amplitudes of the waves with respect to the direction of the wave. In 3D, there are only 3 different amplitude directions possible.

2. Express the two-dimensional integral $\int\mathrm{d}k_x\mathrm{d}k_y$ in terms of polar coordinates. You can assume rotational symmetry.

    One can convert the integral as follows:
    $$
    \int k_x k_y \rightarrow \int_{0}^{2\pi} \mathrm{d} \theta \int_{0}^{\infty} k \mathrm{d} k = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} k \mathrm{d} k
    $$

3. The Einstein model has a material-dependent frequency $\omega_0 = k_\mathrm{B} T_E/\hbar$ of the quantum harmonic oscillators as a free fitting parameter.
What is the material-dependent parameter that plays a similar role in the Debye model?

    The Debye frequency $\omega_d$.

4. Derive an expression for the shortest possible wavelength in the Debye model it in terms of the interatomic distance $a$. Hint: assume that the number of atoms is given by $N=V/a^3$. Discuss if the answer is reasonable.

    From the definition of the Debye frequency, one can calculate that the wavelength is of the order of the interatomic spacing:
    $$
    \lambda = \left(\frac{4}{3}\pi\right)^{1/3} a.
    $$

### Exercise 1: Debye model - concepts
Consider the probability to find an atom of a 1D solid that originally had a position $x$ at a displacement $\delta x$ shown below:

  1. Describe which $k$-states are occupied. Explain your answer.

      It is clear that $n=4$, and thus $k = \frac{2 \pi n}{L} = \pm \frac{4\pi}{L}$.

  2. Describe the concept of $k$-space. What momenta are allowed in a 2D system with dimensions $L\times L$?

      $k$ space is the space of possible momentum states. In 2 dimensions, a period system with dimensions $L\times L$ will have allowed states

      $$
      k_{x,y} = \frac{2\pi}{L} n_{x,y}
      $$

  3. Explain the concept of density of states.

      The density of states $g(\omega)$ is the number of states per frequency

  4. Calculate the density of states $g(\omega)$ for oscillations of a 3D, 2D and 1D solid with linear dispersion $\omega=v_s|\mathbf{k}|$.

      $$
      g(\omega) = \frac{dN}{d\omega} = \frac{dN}{dk}\frac{dk}{d\omega} = \frac{1}{v}\frac{dN}{dk}.
      $$

      We assume that in $d$ dimensions there are $d$ polarizations.

      For 1D we have that $N = \frac{L}{2\pi}\int_{-k}^{k} dk$, hence $g(\omega) = \frac{L}{\pi v}$.

      For 2D we have that $N = 2\left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^2\int d^2k = 2\left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^2\int 2\pi kdk$, hence $g(\omega) = \frac{L^2\omega}{\pi v^2}$.

      For 3D we have that $N = 3\left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^3\int d^3k = 3\left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^3\int 4\pi k^2dk$, hence $g(\omega) = \frac{3L^3\omega^2}{2\pi^2v^3}$.

###  Exercise 2: Debye model in 2D

1. State the assumptions of the Debye model.

    The Debye model treats oscillations as sound waves with no fitting parameters

    * $\omega = v|k|$ similar to light (but with 3 polarisations)
    * Quantisation of waves similar to Planck quantisation of light
    * Maximum cut-off frequency which is necessary to obtain total of $3N$ degrees of freedom

2. Determine the energy of a two-dimensional solid as a function of $T$ using the Debye approximation. You do not have to solve the integral.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    E &= \int_{0}^{\omega_D}g(\omega)\hbar\omega\left(\frac{1}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega} - 1} + \frac{1}{2}\right)d\omega \\
    &= \frac{L^2}{\pi v^2\hbar^2\beta^3}\int_{0}^{\beta\hbar\omega_D}\frac{x^2}{e^{x} - 1}dx + C.
    \end{align}
    $$

3. Calculate the heat capacity in the high $T$ limit.

    High temperature implies $\beta \rightarrow 0$, hence $E = \frac{L^2}{\pi v^2\hbar^2\beta^3}\frac{(\beta\hbar\omega_D)^2}{2} + C$, and then $C = \frac{k_BL^2\omega^2_D}{2\pi v^2} = 2Nk_B$. We've used the value for $\omega_D$ calculated from $2N = \int_{0}^{\omega_D}g(\omega)d\omega$.

4. At low $T$, show that $C_V=KT^{n}$. Find $n$. Express $K$ as an indefinite integral.

    In the low temperature limit we have that $\beta \rightarrow \infty$, hence $E \approx \frac{L^2}{\pi v^2\hbar^2\beta^3}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^2}{e^{x} - 1}dx + C = \frac{2\zeta(3)L^2}{\pi v^2\hbar^2\beta^3} + C$. Finally $C = \frac{6\zeta(3)k^3_BL^2}{\pi v^2\hbar^2}T^2$. We used the fact that $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^2}{e^{x} - 1}dx = 2\zeta(3)$ where $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function.


###  Exercise 3: Different oscillation modes
*(adapted from exercise 2.6a of [The Oxford Solid State Basics](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-solid-state-basics-9780199680771?cc=au&lang=en&))*

During the lecture we derived the low-temperature heat capacity assuming that all the modes of oscillation have the same sound velocity $v$. In reality, the longitudinal and transverse modes have different sound velocities (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound#Longitudinal_and_transverse_waves) for an illustration of different sound wave types).

Assume that there are two types of excitations:

* One longitudinal mode with $\omega = v_\parallel |k|$
* Two transverse modes with $\omega = v_\bot |k|$

<!-- Separate a bullet list from enumeration; fixes a markdown rendering bug -->
1. Write down the total energy of oscillations in this material.

    $$
    g(\omega) = \sum_{\text{polarizations}}\frac{dN}{dk}\frac{dk}{d\omega} = \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^3\sum_{\text{polarizations}}4\pi k^2\frac{dk}{d\omega} =     \frac{L^3}{2\pi^2}\left(\frac{2}{v_\perp^3} + \frac{1}{v_\parallel^3}\right)\omega^2
    $$
    $$
    E = \int_{0}^{\omega_D}g(\omega)\hbar\omega\left(\frac{1}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega} - 1} + \frac{1}{2}\right)d\omega = \frac{L^3}{2\pi^2\hbar^3\beta^4}\left(\frac{2}{v_\perp^3} +     \frac{1}{v_\parallel^3}\right)\int_{0}^{\beta\hbar\omega_D}\frac{x^3}{e^{x} - 1}dx + C.
    $$

2. Verify that at high $T$ you reproduce the Dulong-Petit law.

    Note that we can get $\omega_D$ from $3N = \int_{0}^{\omega_D}g(\omega)$ so everything cancels as usual and we are left with the Dulong-Petit law $C = 3Nk_B$.

3. Compute the behaviour of heat capacity at low $T$.

    In the low temperature limit we have that $C \sim \frac{2\pi^2k_B^4L^3}{15\hbar^3}\left(\frac{2}{v_\perp^3} + \frac{1}{v_\parallel^3}\right)T^3$. We used that $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^3}{e^{x} - 1}dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}$.

### Exercise 4: Anisotropic sound velocities
*(adapted from exercise 2.6b of [The Oxford Solid State Basics](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-solid-state-basics-9780199680771?cc=au&lang=en&))*

Suppose now that the velocity is anisotropic ($v_x \neq v_y \neq v_z$) and $\omega = \sqrt{v_x^2 k_x^2 + v_y^2 k_y^2 + v_z^2 k_z^2}$. How does this change the Debye result for the heat capacity?

??? hint

    Write down the total energy as an integral over $k$, then change the integration variables so that the spherical symmetry of the integrand is restored.

$$
\begin{align}
E & = 3\left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^3\int d^3k\hbar\omega(\mathbf{k})\left(n_B(\beta\hbar\omega(\mathbf{k})) + \frac{1}{2}\right) \\
& = 3\left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^3\frac{1}{v_xv_yv_z}\int d^3\kappa\frac{\hbar\kappa}{e^{\beta\hbar\kappa} - 1} + C,
\end{align}
$$

where we used the substitutions $\kappa_x = k_xv_x,\kappa_y = k_yv_y, \kappa_z = k_zv_z$. Finally

$$
E = \frac{3\hbar L^3}{2\pi^2}\frac{1}{v_xv_yv_z}\int_0^{\kappa_D} d\kappa\frac{\kappa^3}{e^{\beta\hbar\kappa} - 1} + C = \frac{3L^3}{2\pi^2\hbar^3\beta^4}\frac{1}{v_xv_yv_z}\int_0^{\beta\hbar\kappa_D} dx\frac{x^3}{e^{x} - 1} + C,
$$

hence $C = \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} = \frac{6k_B^4L^3T^3}{\pi^2\hbar^3}\frac{1}{v_xv_yv_z}\int_0^{\beta\hbar\kappa_D} dx\frac{x^3}{e^{x} - 1}$. We see that the result is similar to the one with the linear dispersion, the only difference is the factor $1/v_xv_yv_z$ instead of $1/v^3$.
