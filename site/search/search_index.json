Most semiconductors are made up of group IV elements (Si, Ge) or binary compounds between group III-V elements (GaAs). In both cases, there are 4 valance electrons per atom. If we want to increase the average number of electrons per atom, we can add a group V element that has an extra valance electron. We therefore refer to group V elements as donor impurities. However, the extra donor electron is bound to the impurity because group V elements also have an extra proton. In order to estimate the binding strength, we treat the lattice as a background and only consider the system of an electron bound to a proton. We immediately recognize this system as a Hydrogen model with energy levels  The spatial extent of the bound state is given by the Bohr radius:  However, we have to remember that the above equations are written in the free space background. In our case, the extra electron moves in the semiconductor's conduction band and not free space. Therefore, there are a couple of differences from the Hydrogen model. One difference is that the electron's mass is conduction band's effective mass. Another difference is that the interactions between the electron and proton are screened by the lattice. As a result, we need to introduce the following substitutions: , . We thus estimate the energy of the bound state created by the impurity:  with Bohr radius  nm (vs  \u00c5 in Hydrogen). The electron is very weakly bound to the impurity! At room temperature (0.026 eV), the donor electron is easily thermally excited into the conduction band.</p> <p>On the other hand, we can add a group III element to reduce the average number of electrons in the system. Group III elements lacks 1 electron and 1 proton and are therefore known as acceptors. We treat the absence of an electron as a hole and the lacking proton as an effective negative charge. As a result, we once again end up with a Hydrogen model, except this time the charges are flipped (hole circles around a negative center). That allows us to use the previous results and to conclude that an acceptor creates a weakly bound state above the valance band.</p>"},{"location":"6-semiconductors/6-2-devices/#density-of-states-with-donors-and-acceptors","title":"Density of states with donors and acceptors","text":"<p>In order to model multiple donor/acceptor states, we assume that they are all degenerate at the binding energy.

If we keep on adding impurities, then at some point the weakly bound states will begin to overlap.

We must therefore prevent the overlap of impurity bound states.

The process is the same up until the third step - charge conservation. The semiconductor now contains impurities that become charged through ionization.

The Fermi level of an -type semiconductor is close to the donor states. On the other hand, the -type semiconductor has its Fermi level near the acceptor states. At equilibrium (no external fields), we do not expect to see any currents in the system and therefore the Fermi level  must be constant across the system (see \"Equilibrium\" tab).

On the contrary, if the bands were to be discontinuous, then an electric field must develop at a single point in the middle region to shift the bands in energy. However, we do not expect such point-like electric fields to develop because electrons can move freely in semiconductors.</p> <p>On a more microscopic level, the electrons at the junction in the -type semiconductor will move into the -type semiconductor to recombine with the holes. After the recombination, the  and -type semiconductors lose an electron and a hole respectively. As a result, a positive ionized donor dopant is not screened anymore and the -type semiconductor obtains a positive overall charge. Similarly, -type region obtains a negative charge. Therefore, an electric field develops across the junction.
